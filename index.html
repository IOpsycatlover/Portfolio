      SOONYOUNG KIM - 김순영
      I was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1995.
      I immigrated to Pueblo, Colorado in 2011.
      I now live in Blacksburg, Virginia as a college student.
      I study Psychology and Professional & Technical Writing at Virginia Tech.
      I have a smarty cute cat, Sarang, and a dummy chubby cat, Darong.
      I love learning about Skin-Care and Beauty Facial tips.
      I want to go to graduate school for Industrial/Organizational Psychology or Technical Writing.
      I write my thoughts pretty often, but they are mostly in Korean.
      I am in progress of developing my YouTube Channel. (I will link it to this web, once it looks good enough.)
      I hope to dedicate on how to mitigate struggles that people with disabilities have at workplace.
      I regard my attributing goals are 'writing, translation, research, & education' combined with technology.
